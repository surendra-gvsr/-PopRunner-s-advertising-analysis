# -PopRunner-s-advertising-analysis



1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This analysis investigates PopRunner's online advertising effectiveness using data from their customer base, focusing on email blasts and website pop-ups. Our analysis reveals that email campaigns significantly outperformed pop-up advertisements, with email-engaged customers showing an average spend of $240.83 compared to $126.12 for non-engaged customers. The demographic analysis shows a customer base that is predominantly female (76.43%) with varying loyalty levels. While pop-up advertisements reached more customers (50% exposure rate vs 7.93% email open rate), they showed no positive impact on sales, with average purchases actually declining from $138.69 to $131.74. Based on these findings, we recommend prioritizing email marketing while restructuring the pop-up strategy for better engagement.

The analysis demonstrates that email marketing is currently PopRunner's most effective digital advertising channel, despite lower reach compared to pop-ups. The significant difference in average sales between email-engaged and non-engaged customers ($240.83 vs $126.12) suggests that focusing on increasing email open rates could substantially impact revenue. While pop-up advertisements reached more customers, their negative impact on average sales indicates a need for strategic revision. Future marketing efforts should prioritize email campaign expansion while simultaneously working to improve pop-up effectiveness through better targeting and timing.
